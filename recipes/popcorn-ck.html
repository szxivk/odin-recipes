    <h2>Description</h2>
    <p><strong>Popcorn chicken</strong> is a dish of bite-sized chunks of deep-fried chicken that are sure to be a family favorite. I love to serve the chicken with mashed potatoes and green beans.</p>
    <h2>Ingredients</h2>
    <ul>
        <li><strong>3</strong> cups flour</li>
        <li><strong>½</strong> teaspoon salt</li>
        <li><strong>¼</strong> teaspoon ground black pepper</li>
        <li><strong>2</strong> eggs</li>
        <li><strong>2</strong> tablespoons lemon juice</li>
        <li><strong>2</strong> cups oil, or as needed</li>
        <li><strong>3</strong> skinless, boneless chicken breasts, <em>cubed</em></li>
    </ul>
    <h2>Steps</h2>
    <ol>
        <li>Mix flour, garlic powder, salt, and black pepper together in a bowl. Beat eggs and lemon juice together in a separate bowl.</li>
        <li>Heat 2 inches of oil in a large pot over medium heat.</li>
        <li>Dredge chicken pieces in flour mixture; shake off excess. Dip into beaten egg. Lift up so excess egg drips back into the bowl. Press into flour mixture again to coat.</li>
        <li>Lower pieces of chicken carefully into hot oil in batches; fry until golden brown, 7 to 8 minutes. Transfer to a paper towel-lined plate to drain. Repeat with remaining chicken pieces.</li>
        <li>Your <strong>451kcal</strong> tasty popcorn chicken is ready!</li>
