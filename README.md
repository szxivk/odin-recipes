# odin-recipes
A basic recipe website to practice all of the HTML knowledge I have acquired while doing The Odin Project.

## Expectations
The website will contain our main index page with links to a few recipes. The project-assignment stands to help me solidify my HTML know-how (It won't look cool by any means). We are expected to style it later using CSS, much later in the odin project's foundations course.
