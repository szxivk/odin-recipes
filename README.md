# odin-recipes
This repository contains a basic recipe website created as part of an assignment from [The Odin Project](https://www.theodinproject.com/lessons/foundations-recipes). The project focuses on practicing foundational HTML skills by building a main index page with links to individual recipe pages.

## Expectations
The website will contain our main index page with links to a few recipes. The project-assignment stands to help me solidify my HTML know-how (It won't look cool by any means). We are expected to style it later using CSS, much later in the odin project's foundations course.
